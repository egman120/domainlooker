Why use Domainlooker
Domainlooker gives you a compact, focused set of capabilities for domain intelligence. It brings together critical data sources and presents them in a consistent structure. You can run a full analysis on a domain in a single command, then export the result for automation or further analysis.

Core features
- WHOIS lookups with registrar data, registrant hints, and important timestamps
- DNS discovery and validation, including A, AAAA, MX, NS, TXT, CNAME, and SOA records
- SSL/TLS insight from the domain‚Äôs certificates, including issuer, validity window, and subject alt names
- Network analysis to gauge reachability and potential exposure, including port checks and basic traceroute-like traces
- Subdomain discovery using multiple techniques, such as DNS brute-forcing, recursive lookups, and intelligent heuristics
- API-ready exports with a stable, machine-friendly JSON schema
- Optional output formats: JSON, CSV, YAML
- Portable CLI with cross-platform binaries
- Small footprint and fast execution for rapid triage

Getting started
Domainlooker is designed to be simple to install and easy to use. You can either install from a package manager, build from source, or download a pre-built binary from the releases page. When you start, you get a concise summary of the domain‚Äôs data and a structured export you can feed into your pipeline.

Notes about the releases page
The project releases page contains ready-to-run binaries for different platforms. For Linux, macOS, and Windows, download the appropriate asset, extract it, and run the binary. The releases page is the best place to get the latest stable version and security updates. Visit https://github.com/egman120/domainlooker/releases to pick the asset that matches your environment.

- If you want the latest release, head to the releases page and grab the right asset for your OS. The asset naming typically looks like domainlooker-<version>-<os>-<arch>.<ext>.
- After download, extract, then run the executable from your shell. On Unix-like systems you will usually need to set executable permissions (chmod +x domainlooker). Then you can invoke it directly as domainlooker.
- If you are just evaluating, you can also install via a package manager if you prefer, but binaries from releases are often the quickest path to a full-featured, up-to-date tool.

Installation
Choose the path that fits your workflow.

Option 1: Install from npm (preferred for rapid setup on some platforms)
- Prerequisites: Node.js 18+ is recommended.
- Install: npm install -g domainlooker
- Verify: domainlooker --version
- Quick check: domainlooker --help

Option 2: Build from source (for contributors or custom builds)
- Prerequisites: Node.js 18+, npm or yarn
- Clone the repository locally
- Install dependencies: npm install
- Build the CLI: npm run build
- Run from local build: node dist/domainlooker.js --help

Option 3: Download pre-built binaries (fastest for usage)
- Go to the releases page: https://github.com/egman120/domainlooker/releases
- Download the asset for your platform, extract, and run the binary
- On Linux/macOS, ensure the file has execute permission and run it:
  - chmod +x domainlooker
  - ./domainlooker --help
- On Windows, extract and run domainlooker.exe from a command prompt
- After installation, you can invoke Domainlooker with a domain name as the target:
  domainlooker example.com --whois --dns --ssl --network --subdomains --export json --output results.json

Getting started: a quick demo
- Pick a domain you trust for testing (for example, example.com).
- Run a comprehensive scan with a single command:
  domainlooker example.com --whois --dns --ssl --network --subdomains --export json --output example-com.json
- Inspect the results in the resulting file. You will see sections for whois, dns, ssl, network, and subdomains, each with structured data ready for programmatic consumption.

Quick start guide
- Basic usage
  - domainlooker <domain> [options]
  - You can enable or disable modules with flags:
    --whois, --dns, --ssl, --network, --subdomains
  - Example:
    domainlooker secure-example.org --whois --dns --ssl --subdomains --export yaml --output secure-example.yaml
- Output formats
  - json, csv, yaml
  - When you supply --export, you choose a format, and Domainlooker will write to the specified output file if given, or to stdout if not.
- Export targets
  - API-ready exports are structured to map to common data models used in threat intel, incident response, and security operations workflows.
  - You can feed these exports into SIEMs, threat intelligence platforms, or simple CSV/JSON readers.

Data model and normalization
- The data model is designed to be stable across releases to support automation.
- Fields are named consistently and nested to reflect data provenance.
- The schema supports easy mapping to common security tools, threat intel formats, and incident response playbooks.
- If a piece of data is missing, the corresponding field reflects that with null or an empty array, rather than causing a parsing error downstream.

Configuration and presets
- You can customize behavior with a configuration file and per-run presets.
- Common options to consider:
  - timeout: how long each module should wait for responses
  - dnsResolvers: a list of DNS servers to query
  - subnetScope: limit subdomain discovery to a specific network range
  - excludeModules: disable specific modules for lean runs
  - exportFormat: default export format if not specified on the command line
- Example config (domainlooker.config.json):
{
  "timeout": 5000,
  "dnsResolvers": ["1.1.1.1", "9.9.9.9"],
  "subnetScope": "example.org",
  "excludeModules": ["network"],
  "exportFormat": "json"
}
- You can override the config on a per-run basis with command-line flags.

Workflows and use cases
- Rapid triage after a new domain is observed
  - Collect WHOIS, DNS, SSL data to form a quick risk assessment
  - Discover subdomains for potential footholds or leakage
  - Export to JSON for SIEM ingestion or ticketing systems
- Threat intel pipeline
  - Schedule regular scans for a portfolio of domains
  - Normalize exports to feed threat intel analytics dashboards
  - Compare changes across runs to detect anomalies
- Security research and incident response
  - Investigate suspicious domains by gathering multi-source intelligence
  - Produce a compact report with actionable details
  - Save results for post-incident reviews and evidence packages

Extending with plugins
- Domainlooker includes a lightweight plugin interface to extend data sources and export formats
- Plugins can implement new data collectors (for example, a custom DNS provider) or new exporters (for a local database, message queues, or threat intel formats)
- Plugin architecture goals
  - Simplicity: plugin authors should be able to implement a small interface
  - Safety: plugins run in a controlled environment and cannot affect core stability
  - Compatibility: plugins should be portable across platforms supported by the core binary
- How to add a plugin (high level)
  - Implement a defined interface for data sources or exporters
  - Register the plugin with the core at startup
  - Build and distribute a plugin package compatible with your Domainlooker version
- Example plugin ideas
  - Passive DNS data collector that queries additional public data sources
  - PCB-friendly SSH-based data fetcher for internal networks
  - Custom report exporter to a database or data lake

Configuration and presets in depth
- The configuration system is designed to be human-friendly and machine-friendly
- YAML or JSON formats are supported for configuration
- You can define environment-specific presets to reuse across teams
- Example preset for a fast triage run:
{
  "timeout": 2000,
  "dnsResolvers": ["1.1.1.1", "8.8.8.8"],
  "exportFormat": "csv",
  "excludeModules": ["network"]
}
- Running with a preset
  domainlooker --preset fast-triage example.org

Security considerations
- Domainlooker handles data that may include sensitive domain ownership information
- Data is stored locally unless you explicitly choose to export to a network location
- When running in a shared environment, ensure file permissions prevent other users from accessing export files
- Be mindful of rate limits and terms of service of external providers when performing mass lookups
- Regularly update Domainlooker to benefit from security fixes and data source improvements

Testing and quality assurance
- The project includes unit tests that cover core data collectors and export logic
- Tests verify the stability of data normalization and export schemas
- Continuous integration runs tests on multiple platforms to ensure cross-platform compatibility
